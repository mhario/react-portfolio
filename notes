My passion for coding began at a young age. I was maybe twelve years old when I picked up a copy of Stroustrupâ€™s own C++ text.

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. 

I'm Mark and I've been building web apps for over two years.

There's a bit more about me below. Please peruse my side projects, with which I've practiced my craft, and feel free to leave any feedback as well.
