    "My name is Mark Hario, and I have been building software full-time for about four years. My passion for coding began at a young age, when I picked up a copy of Stroustrup's own C++ text and taught myself to write a basic linked list on a 100 mHz PC running Windows 95. Then later, I followed a YouTube lecture series and built a small Java game.",

  //   "During high school, I (for better or worse,) made the decision to pursue a career in welding. I figured I would keep computers as a hobby, and get a “real job.” Fast forward a few years, and I was programming Robotic Welding systems, having earned a Bachelor's Degree in Welding Engineering Technology; but I had the unshakable feeling of having erred. I enjoyed my work but was aware that I had not been following my true passion.",
  //   "It worked out. I missed the worst of the browser wars and returned to my true passion just as these lovely frameworks became mature. I spent several weeks researching coding bootcamps to select one that would be as comprehensive as possible. I settled on the Fullstack Academy Remote Immersive Program.",

    "More recently, my focus has been on JavaScript. I've spent about two years as a front-end focused developer, reproducing pixel-perfect designs with full accessibility features. I've also built Node APIs, Mongoose collections, maintained C# apps, and done design/requirements work.",
    "This past year, I've stepped up to an Engineering Management role, while having also served as product owner and scrum master. I'm also developing my skills in AWS, Docker, and general DevOps knowledge.",
    "There are many exciting opportunities to pursue in the world of software and web development. I'm most curious to learn more about big data or machine learning; or in applying those tools in meaningful ways. I would like to help to apply statistical knowledge and understanding to affect decision making in the real world.",
