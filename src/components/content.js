    "My name is Mark Hario, and I have been building software full-time for over two years. My passion for coding began at a young age, when I picked up a copy of Stroustrup's own C++ text and taught myself to write a basic linked list on a 100 mHz PC running Windows 95.",

    "During high school, I (for better or worse,) made the decision to pursue a career in welding. I figured I would keep computers as a hobby, and get a “real job.” Fast forward a few years, and I was programming Robotic Welding systems, having earned a Bachelor's Degree in Welding Engineering Technology; but I had the unshakable feeling of having erred. I enjoyed my work but was aware that I had not been following my true passion.",
    "It worked out. I missed the worst of the browser wars and returned to my true passion just as these lovely frameworks became mature. I spent several weeks researching coding bootcamps to select one that would be as comprehensive as possible. I settled on the Fullstack Academy Remote Immersive Program.",
    "Over the course of six months, I went from factory work in Des Moines, Iowa, to software engineering in Boulder, CO (and more recently, down to neighboring Broomfield.) And now I'm looking for new opportunities! I am hoping to work with data and statistics...",

    "More recently, my focus has been on front-end development with an emphasis on accessibility. While I've also spent some time developing APIs and maintaining legacy code, I've found the most reward to be in frontend work. I enjoy building experiences, and working to ensure that everyone has equal access to the internet.",
    "There are many exciting opportunities to pursue in the world of software and web development. I'm most curious to learn more about big data or machine learning; or in applying those tools in meaningful ways. I would like to help to apply statistical knowledge and understanding to affect decision making in the real world.",
