    "My focus has been on front-end development with an emphasis on accessibility. While I've also spent time developing APIs, I found the most fun to be had in laying out an interface and populating it with fun animations that can delight the user: and ensuring that those with disabilities are not left behind either.",
    "There are many exciting opportunities to pursue in the world of software and web development. I'm most curious to learn more about big data or machine learning; or in applying those tools in meaningful ways. I want to apply knowledge to affect decision making in the real world.",
    "There's a bit more about me below. Please peruse my side projects, with which I've practiced my craft, and feel free to leave any feedback as well."
